Bibliometric dataset and analysis scripts of AI applications in natural carbon sequestration research (2025)
# AI-NatureCarbon-Biblio

This repository hosts a curated bibliometric dataset and associated outputs from a study on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in natural carbon sequestration research**. The dataset comprises **3885 records** retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection as of **June 10, 2025**, and was analyzed using mainstream bibliometric tools including **Bibliometrix (R)**, **CiteSpace**, and **VOSviewer**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This work aims to uncover the structure, trends, and knowledge frontiers of AI-empowered research in **natural carbon sinks**, excluding CCUS-related domains. The study focuses on AI applications in:

- Forest carbon and biomass mapping  
- Soil and wetland carbon sequestration  
- Blue carbon (mangroves, seagrass, salt marshes)  
- Marine carbon flux and phytoplankton modeling  
- Carbon stock modeling and ecosystem simulation

## 📊 Dataset Description

The `/data` folder includes detailed Excel tables automatically generated by **Bibliometrix**, covering:

- **1 Overview**: Publication trends and citation patterns
- **2 Sources**: Top journals, source impact, Bradford’s Law
- **3 Authors & Affiliations**: Productivity, impact, country-level trends
- **4 Documents & References**: Most cited documents, keyword analysis
- **5 Clustering**: Co-word clustering and thematic analysis
- **6 Conceptual & Intellectual Structure**: Thematic maps, factorial analysis, co-citation networks
- **8 Collaboration**: Global collaboration patterns among countries

All files are named according to their function (e.g., `Most_Frequent_Words.xlsx`, `Co-citation_Network.xlsx`) for easy reference.

## 📈 Tools Used

This study employed the following tools:
- **Bibliometrix** (R package): Statistical analysis, clustering, thematic mapping
- **VOSviewer**: Keyword co-occurrence and visual network analysis
- **CiteSpace**: Burst detection, co-citation, historiographic mapping

## 🔍 Search Strategy

The full search string used in the Web of Science Core Collection is provided in [`keywords_query.txt`](./keywords_query.txt). It includes terms such as:

> ("artificial intelligence" OR "machine learning" OR "deep learning" ...)  
> AND ("forest carbon" OR "soil organic carbon" OR "blue carbon" ...)  
> NOT ("CCUS" OR "CO2 capture" OR "carbon capture and storage" ...)

The goal was to **exclude engineered carbon capture (CCUS)** and focus solely on **natural carbon sequestration pathways**.
