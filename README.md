## 🎯 Purpose

This work aims to uncover the structure, trends, and knowledge frontiers of AI-empowered research in **natural carbon sinks**, excluding CCUS-related domains. The study focuses on AI applications in:

- Forest carbon and biomass mapping  
- Soil and wetland carbon sequestration  
- Blue carbon (mangroves, seagrass, salt marshes)  
- Marine carbon flux and phytoplankton modeling  
- Carbon stock modeling and ecosystem simulation
